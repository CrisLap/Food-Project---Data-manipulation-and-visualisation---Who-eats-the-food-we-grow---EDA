Data Manipulation and Visualization - Food project

Data used and context
This is the second project of the Data Science course of start2impact.

The use of two datases was suggested. All datases are available on Kaggle:

The first, available on FAOSTAT portal of the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) website, contains data on the production of food and feed worldwide, from 1961 to 2013.

The second, provided by Our World in Data, mainly shows the quantities of greenhouse gases that are emitted in the various steps of the production chain of 43 of the most produced foods in the world.



Project objective and requirements
Objective:
Based on data on the worldwide production and distribution of food and feed, analyze the impact that these have on the environment.

The work must be delivered bearing in mind that the Jupyter notebook must be similar to a presentation to be shown to a hypothetical customer: avoid projects that are too verbose and repetitive in the analysis. Choosing which concept to show and why, avoiding unnecessary information is one of the skills to develop for this project.

The project must be divided in 6 parts:

Discovery (problem identification and objectives)
Data selection
Data cleaning
Data exploration
Data transformation
Data visualization
Libraries used
numpy
pandas
plotly (express)
missingno
matplotlib
seaborn
Notes
To corretly display the graphs I recommend opening the project on nbviewer. This is the link:
